Elastic-memory controller
=================================================

This folder contains source code associated to the following article submitted to [CCGrid2015](http://cloud.siat.ac.cn/ccgrid2015/): 
> Performance Adaptation of Cloud-based Applications via Memory Elasticity: A Control-theoretic Approach. 

The [workload folder](https://github.com/Soodeh/CCGrid2015/tree/master/Workloads) includes two iPython notebooks, each for different workload trace which is used at the experimental evaluation of this paper. Each notebook consists of the preparation code of the used workloads. 

Afterwards, we used the scripts at the [script folder](https://github.com/Soodeh/CCGrid2015/tree/master/httpmon-scripts) as the input of [httpmon tool](https://github.com/cloud-control/httpmon) as a workload generator to send http GET request to the [RUBBoS benchmark application](https://github.com/cristiklein/brownout/tree/rubbos-icse2014/PHP).
