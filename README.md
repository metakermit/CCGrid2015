This folder contains source code associated to the following article submitted to CCGrid2015: "Performance Adaptation of Cloud-based Applications \\via Memory Elasticity: A Control-theoretic Approach". 

The workload folder includes two iPython notebooks, each for different workload trace which is used at the experimental evaluation of this paper. 
Each notebook consists of the preparation code of the used workloads. Afterwards, we used the scripts at the script folder as the input of httpmon tool as a workload generator to send http GET request to the RUBBoS benchmark application.
